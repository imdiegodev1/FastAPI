# FastAPI
Here are some projects focused on the creation of APIs with Python and the FastAPI library


## Twitter:

The purpose of this project is to explore the FastAPI library in depth, use as many features as possible and have fun imagining the possible endpoints twitter has for its users. The logic behind each endpoint was not important in this project but it is something I will have fun with later on.

There you can find two response models:

### User
It has the following endpoints:
- signup
- login
- show_all_users
- show_a_user
- delete_a_user
- update_a_user

### Tweets
It has the following endpoints:
- home
- post_a_tweet
- delete_a_tweet
- update_a_tweet
